   <p>Islamic Golden Eleven is a football club formed in March, 2023 by a group of eleven Muslim youth within New Atuabo community - a suburb of Tarkwa (a mining town).</p>
   <p>The team played its first ever match against Herbal Boys FC - a strong side within the locality. The game ended 1-0 in favour of Herbal Boys FC but we held our heads high due to the fact that we fielded only eleven (11) with no substitutes and also for the fact that we played immediately after a month-long fasting period.</p>
   <p>After the game, <a href="Spovis Haruna Yakubu.html">Spovis Haruna Yakubu</a>, impressed with the performance of the player, decided to name the group "Islamic Golden Eleven" and declared it an active team.</p>
